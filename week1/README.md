# Week 1 – 60 Days of Code (C++)

## Day 1: 23rd June 2025

### ✅ Q1: Search Insert Position (LeetCode #35)
- Practiced binary search to find the correct insert location
- Learned: lower_bound logic and boundary conditions

### ✅ Q2: Count Primes (LeetCode #204)
- Applied Sieve of Eratosthenes to count all primes < n
- Learned: Optimizing using boolean arrays and inner loop starting at `i*i`

**Time Spent:** ~40 mins  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Reflection:** Getting back to basic problems helped me warm up my logical flow. Binary search was a refresher, and sieve optimization was fun to revisit.

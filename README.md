# ðŸ’» 60 Days of Code â€“ C++ DSA Challenge (UPES)

## ðŸ“˜ What's This?
This repo logs my journey through the "60 Days of Code". Iâ€™m focusing on C++, and honestly, itâ€™s still the fastest way to build DSA intuition.

## ðŸ§  What You'll Find Here
- Solutions to standard problems (arrays, maps, recursion, etc.)
- Each week in its own folder (`week1`, `week2`, ...)
- Comments in code where I got stuck or optimized something

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- 50â€“70 solid problems between June 21 and August 15
- Keep it clean, concise, and GitHub-ready
- Use this as proof-of-effort during interviews and college reviews

## ðŸ’¾ Tools Used
- C++ (g++ compiler)
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## âœ… Current Status
Started logging problems from June 23. Pushes happen weekly. Feedback welcome!
